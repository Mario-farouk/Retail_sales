# Retail_sales
The data in this report is used as an
economic indicator to understand trends in US consumer spending patterns. While
gross domestic product (GDP) figures are published quarterly, this retail sales data is
published monthly, so it is also used to help predict GDP. For both of these reasons,
the latest figures are usually covered in the business press when they are released.
The data spans from 1992 to 2020 and includes both total sales as well as details for
subcategories of retail sales. It contains both unadjusted and seasonally adjusted
numbers. This chapter will use the unadjusted numbers, since one of the goals is ana‚Äê
lyzing seasonality. Sales figures are in millions of US dollars. The original file format
is an Excel file, with a tab for each year and with months as columns.
